         * *****Java is an object-oriented programming language. Everything in Java is
         * an
         * object. Object-oriented means we organize our software as a combination of
         * different types of objects that incorporate both data and behavior.*****
         * 
         * Basic concepts of OOPs are:
         * Object
         * Class
         * Inheritance
         * Polymorphism
         * Abstraction
         * Encapsulation
         * 
         * ***Java code can be executed on multiple platforms, for example, Windows,
         * Linux, Sun Solaris, Mac/OS, etc. Java code is compiled by the compiler and
         * converted into bytecode. This bytecode is a platform-independent code because
         * it can be run on multiple platforms, i.e., Write Once and Run Anywhere
         * (WORA).
         * 
         * VM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine. It is called a virtual
         * machine because it doesn't physically exist. It is a specification that
         * provides a runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed. It can
         * also run those programs which are written in other languages and compiled to
         * Java bytecode.
         * 
         * The JVM performs the following main tasks:
         * 1.Loads code
         * 2.Verifies code
         * 3.Executes code
         * 4.Provides runtime environment
         * 
         * JRE::
         * JRE is an acronym for Java Runtime Environment. It is also written as Java
         * RTE. The Java Runtime Environment is a set of software tools which are used
         * for developing Java applications. It is used to provide the runtime
         * environment. It is the implementation of JVM. It physically exists. It
         * contains a set of libraries + other files that JVM uses at runtime.
         * 
         * JDK::
         * JDK is an acronym for Java Development Kit. The Java Development Kit (JDK) is
         * a software development environment which is used to develop Java applications
         * and applets. It physically exists. It contains JRE + development tools.
         * he JDK contains a private Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and a few other
         * resources such as an interpreter/loader (java), a compiler (javac), an
         * archiver (jar), a documentation generator (Javadoc), etc. to complete the
         * development of a Java Application.
         * 
         * => Variable
         * A variable is the name of a reserved area allocated in memory.
         * 
         * Types of Variables
         * There are three types of variables in Java:
         * 1.local variable
         * 2.instance variable
         * 3.static variable

        System.out.println("Hi");
