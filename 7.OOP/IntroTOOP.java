 **************Classes and objects***********************************************************
 A class defines the data fields and actions of an object
 Class also defines structure of objects
 Classes act as blueprint of objects
 An object is an instance of an class
 Objects of the same type are created/instantiated from the same class
 A java class uses variables to define the data fields and methods to define actions. . 
There are special methods called constructors
A constructor can do anything ,it is simply a method,but it is designed to do initializing actions,
such as initializing the data fields of an object.
A constructor doesn't have a return type
The parameters of a constructor should have the same name as data fields of the class
Default constructor takes no parameters
